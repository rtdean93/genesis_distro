<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>You must first contact your NASDAQ OMX Group representative and have them set up your irXML sandbox account. Once this has been done, you will be assigned a Company ID and PIN. Once you have received this information, you can proceed to the module configuration page and enter these credentials in the approprate fields. You will also need to set the domain which the NASDAQ OMX Group uses to host your press releases (i.e. http://investor.yourdomain.com). All of these configuration values are required and used throughout the module to dynamically build the module content.</p>
